## Open Questions for the Obs4MIPs MSU/AMSU forward operator

### Land Fraction
Should we use each model's land fraction (sftlf) or use a common land fraction maps.  The same question applies to surface height/orography.  

### Sea Ice Fraction
Should we use each model's sea ice fraction, or using a common sea ice fraction based on historical data.  I (Carl) thinks that most users of MSU/AMSU data are interested in atmospheric temperature.  In that case, we should use the real-world sea ice so that the results from the forward operator reflect changes in the atmosphere, not at the surface.
